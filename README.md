Chemical fingerprinting is used to identify and characterize a substance by analyzing its unique chemical composition. This process essentially creates a "fingerprint" of the substance, thus allowing for comparison to known samples. Chemical fingerprinting enables tasks like materials quality control, source identification, and contaminant detection in various fields like environmental monitoring, food and drug analysis, forensics, molecules analysis and drug discovery to be easily accomplished

ChemBERTa, an adaptation of the popular RoBERTa machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm has been found to be quite useful for chemical fingerprinting, and molecules properties prediction when trained on the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) data set. SMILES is the world largest open sources collections of chemical and molecules structures. 

Big Pharma Company (BPC) is seeking to leverage its extensive materials data sets and the ChemBERTa algorithm for chemical fingerprinting, molecules identification, molecule representation, and molecules properties prediction. 

Deloitte SFL engineers will be able to assist BPC by leveraging Deloitteâ€™s expertise in machine learning, software development and natural language programming processing (NLP) to achieve an implementation of the ChemBERTa algorithm using BPC data.
